The objective of this project was to create a Pokedex on Python using the pypokedex library. 
I chose to use pypokedex because it can pull Pokemon data from the PokéAPI.

Using this Pokedex, a pokemon can be accessed by searching it's ID number or Name.
The following information will appear upon searching for a Pokémon:
- ID Number
- Name
- Type
- Height (m)
- Weight (kg)
- Base statistics (HP, attack, defence, speed)

Libraries that were utilised in this project include:
- pypokedex for accessing pokemon data in PokéAPI
- Pillow for handling image files
- Tkinter as a GUI toolkit
- Matplotlib for plotting
- Urllib3 for handling urls
- IO for processing image data
